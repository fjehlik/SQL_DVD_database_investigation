
QUESTION 1:
Create a query that lists each movie, the film category it is classified in, and the number of times it has been rented out.

SELECT f.title AS film_title, c.name as film_category, COUNT(r.rental_id) AS num_rentals 

FROM film f
JOIN film_category fc 
ON f.film_id = fc.film_id
JOIN category c 
ON fc.category_id = c.category_id
JOIN inventory i 
ON f.film_id = i.film_id
JOIN rental r
ON i.inventory_id = r.inventory_id 
GROUP BY film_category, film_title
ORDER BY film_category, film_title



QUESTION 2:
Create a query that lists the total amount of DVD rentals by film category and the amount earned in each category to determine the most popular forms of film. Note that the total amount 
earned may not be the same as the number of rentals per category. This calculates the average per rental to determine the most profitable films per genre.  

SELECT c.name as film_category, COUNT(r.rental_id) AS num_rentals, ROUND(SUM(p.amount),0) AS tot_earned, ROUND(SUM(p.amount) / COUNT(r.rental_id),2) AS avg_per_rental

FROM film_category fc 
JOIN film f
ON f.film_id = fc.film_id
JOIN category c 
ON fc.category_id = c.category_id
JOIN inventory i 
ON f.film_id = i.film_id
JOIN rental r
ON i.inventory_id = r.inventory_id 
JOIN payment p 
ON r.rental_id = p.rental_id

GROUP BY c.name 
ORDER BY avg_per_rental DESC


QUESTION 3:
Create a query that determines the most profitable actor in total sales and per rental. 

SELECT a.first_name || ' ' || a.last_name AS actor, COUNT(r.rental_id) AS num_rentals, ROUND(SUM(p.amount),0) AS tot_earned, ROUND(SUM(p.amount) / COUNT(r.rental_id),2) AS avg_per_rental
FROM actor a
JOIN film_actor fa
ON a.actor_id = fa.actor_id
JOIN film f
ON fa.film_id = f.film_id
JOIN inventory i 
ON f.film_id = i.film_id
JOIN rental r
ON i.inventory_id = r.inventory_id 
JOIN payment p 
ON r.rental_id = p.rental_id
GROUP by actor
ORDER BY tot_earned DESC

Question 4:  
Create a query that determines the average monthly DVD sales, per genre, over a year to determine which film categories are popular and when they are popular.
